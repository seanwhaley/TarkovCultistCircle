    "executive_summary": "TarkovCultistCircle is a lightweight Flask-based web application designed for optimizing item trading in Escape from Tarkov. The project integrates with the Tarkov.dev GraphQL API for item data and uses Neo4j for efficient graph-based item relationship management. The application features a Material Design 3 UI, basic authentication, and rate limiting. It follows a clear MVC architecture with modular design principles and emphasizes simplicity and maintainability over complex features.",

# Project Requirements

1. Use a Neo4j database for data storage.
2. Implement a Flask application.
3. Use Docker for containerization.
4. Use Docker Compose for multi-container setup.
5. Secure the Flask application with a secret key.
6. Configure the Flask application for development and production environments.
7. Expose the Flask application on port 5000.
8. Use environment variables for configuration.
9. Implement a health check for the Neo4j service.
10. Use NVIDIA GPU resources for the web service.
11. Implement GraphQL endpoint integration.
12. Ensure proper memory and resource allocation for Neo4j.
13. Provide detailed setup and usage instructions.
14. Implement unit tests for the Flask application.
15. Ensure all blueprints are located in the `src/blueprints` folder.
16. Create a factory function to initialize the Flask app.
17. Set up blueprints for modularity.
18. Configure logging for the Flask application.
19. Use configuration classes for different environments.
20. Add docstrings and comments for clarity.

6. NVIDIA GPU resources are configured in `docker-compose.yml`.
7. GraphQL endpoint is configured in `.env`.
8. Memory and resource allocation for Neo4j is configured in `.env` and `docker-compose.yml`.
9. Setup and usage instructions are provided in `docs/README.md`.
10. Unit tests are implemented for routes, models, services, utilities, error handling, authentication, database interactions, and form validation.
11. Factory function to initialize the Flask app is implemented.
12. Blueprints for modularity are set up.
13. Logging for the Flask application is configured.
14. Configuration classes for different environments are used.
15. Docstrings and comments for clarity are added.

## Future State Analysis

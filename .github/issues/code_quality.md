## Technical Context
Set up and configure code quality tools to enforce consistent standards and catch issues early.

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Configure Black for code formatting
- [ ] Set up Ruff for fast linting
- [ ] Implement MyPy for type checking
- [ ] Add Bandit for security scanning
- [ ] Configure pre-commit framework

## Implementation Plan
1. Add pre-commit configuration:
   ```yaml
   repos:
   - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
     rev: v4.5.0
     hooks:
       - id: trailing-whitespace
       - id: end-of-file-fixer
       - id: check-yaml
       - id: check-toml
       - id: debug-statements

   - repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
     rev: v0.1.6
     hooks:
       - id: ruff
         args: [--fix]
       - id: ruff-format

   - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy
     rev: v1.7.1
     hooks:
       - id: mypy
         additional_dependencies: [types-all]

   - repo: https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit
     rev: 1.7.5
     hooks:
       - id: bandit
         args: [-c, pyproject.toml]
   ```

2. Add tool configurations in pyproject.toml:
   ```toml
   [tool.ruff]
   target-version = "py39"
   line-length = 88
   fix = true
   
   [tool.mypy]
   python_version = "3.9"
   strict = true
   
   [tool.bandit]
   exclude_dirs = ["tests"]
   ```

3. Set up CI checks
4. Add VS Code settings
5. Update documentation

## Affected Components
- All Python source files
- CI/CD pipeline
- Editor configurations
- Development workflow docs

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks running successfully
- [ ] CI pipeline enforcing all checks
- [ ] VS Code integration working
- [ ] Documentation updated for developers

## Dependencies
- Issue #1: Poetry Implementation (for tool dependencies)
- Issue #2: Testing Infrastructure (for CI integration)

## Technical Context
Implement comprehensive testing infrastructure using pytest, pytest-cov, and other testing tools to ensure code quality and reliability.

## Current State
Basic unittest setup with manual test running and no automated coverage reporting.

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Migrate to pytest for testing
- [ ] Add pytest-cov for coverage reporting
- [ ] Implement pytest-xdist for parallel testing
- [ ] Add pytest-mock for better mocking
- [ ] Set up pytest-bdd for behavior testing
- [ ] Configure pytest-asyncio for async testing

## Implementation Plan
1. Add pytest configuration:
   ```ini
   [tool.pytest.ini_options]
   minversion = "6.0"
   addopts = "-ra -q --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term"
   testpaths = ["tests"]
   python_files = ["test_*.py"]
   python_classes = ["Test*"]
   python_functions = ["test_*"]
   markers = [
       "unit: marks tests as unit tests",
       "integration: marks tests as integration tests",
       "e2e: marks tests as end-to-end tests"
   ]
   ```

2. Set up pre-commit hooks:
   ```yaml
   - repo: local
     hooks:
       - id: pytest
         name: pytest
         entry: pytest
         language: system
         types: [python]
         pass_filenames: false
   ```

3. Configure Coverage Settings:
   ```toml
   [tool.coverage.run]
   branch = true
   source = ["src"]

   [tool.coverage.report]
   exclude_lines = [
       "pragma: no cover",
       "def __repr__",
       "if __name__ == .__main__.:",
       "raise NotImplementedError",
       "if TYPE_CHECKING:"
   ]
   ```

4. Update CI pipeline
5. Update documentation

## Affected Components
- tests/ directory structure
- CI/CD configuration
- Development workflow
- Pre-commit hooks
- Documentation

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] All tests run with pytest
- [ ] Coverage reports generated automatically
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks working
- [ ] CI pipeline updated
- [ ] Documentation reflects new testing approach

## Dependencies
- Issue #1: Poetry Implementation (for managing test dependencies)

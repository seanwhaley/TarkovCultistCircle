## Technical Context
Improve container setup and deployment process with best practices and modern tools.

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Implement multi-stage Docker builds
- [ ] Add Compose profiles for different environments
- [ ] Configure health checks
- [ ] Set up container security scanning
- [ ] Implement resource limits
- [ ] Add container monitoring

## Implementation Plan
1. Update Dockerfile with multi-stage build:
   ```dockerfile
   # Build stage
   FROM python:3.9-slim as builder
   WORKDIR /app
   RUN pip install poetry
   COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock ./
   RUN poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt

   # Runtime stage
   FROM python:3.9-slim
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY --from=builder /app/requirements.txt .
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
   COPY . .
   ```

2. Add Docker Compose profiles:
   ```yaml
   services:
     app:
       profiles:
         - dev
         - prod
       build:
         context: .
         target: ${BUILD_TARGET:-runtime}
       healthcheck:
         test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8000/health"]
         interval: 30s
         timeout: 10s
         retries: 3
       deploy:
         resources:
           limits:
             cpus: '1'
             memory: 1G
   ```

3. Set up container scanning
4. Configure monitoring
5. Update CI/CD pipeline

## Affected Components
- Dockerfile
- docker-compose.yml
- CI/CD pipeline
- Deployment scripts
- Monitoring setup

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] Multi-stage builds working
- [ ] Environment profiles functioning
- [ ] Health checks active
- [ ] Security scans passing
- [ ] Resource limits enforced
- [ ] Monitoring operational

## Dependencies
- Issue #1: Poetry Implementation
- Issue #4: FastAPI Migration (for health checks)

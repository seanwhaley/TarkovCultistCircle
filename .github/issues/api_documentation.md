## Technical Context
Migrate from Flask to FastAPI for better type safety, automatic documentation, and built-in validation.

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Replace Flask with FastAPI
- [ ] Implement Pydantic models for all data structures
- [ ] Set up Strawberry for GraphQL integration
- [ ] Configure automatic API documentation
- [ ] Add request/response validation

## Implementation Plan
1. Add FastAPI and dependencies:
   ```toml
   [tool.poetry.dependencies]
   fastapi = "^0.104.0"
   strawberry-graphql = "^0.209.0"
   pydantic = "^2.4.0"
   uvicorn = "^0.23.0"
   ```

2. Migrate routes to FastAPI:
   ```python
   # Example structure
   from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
   from strawberry.fastapi import GraphQLRouter
   import strawberry
   from pydantic import BaseModel

   app = FastAPI(title="Tarkov Cultist Circle")
   ```

3. Convert models to Pydantic
4. Update GraphQL schema with Strawberry
5. Configure OpenAPI documentation

## Affected Components
- All route handlers
- Data models
- GraphQL schema
- API documentation
- Tests
- Docker configuration

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] All API endpoints working with FastAPI
- [ ] GraphQL integration functioning
- [ ] OpenAPI documentation available
- [ ] Request validation working
- [ ] Updated tests passing

## Dependencies
- Issue #1: Poetry Implementation
- Issue #3: Code Quality Tools (for type checking)

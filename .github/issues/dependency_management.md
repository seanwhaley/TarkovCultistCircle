## Technical Context
Switch to Poetry for dependency management to handle package versions and dependencies in a more robust way.

## Current State
Using requirements.txt with hard-coded versions, which is prone to version conflicts and manual updates.

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Install and configure Poetry
- [ ] Migrate from requirements.txt to pyproject.toml
- [ ] Set up dependency groups for development, testing, and production
- [ ] Configure pre-commit hooks for dependency updates
- [ ] Integrate with CI/CD pipeline

## Implementation Plan
1. Add Poetry configuration:
   ```toml
   [tool.poetry]
   name = "tarkov-cultist-circle"
   version = "1.0.0"
   description = "Market optimization tool for Escape from Tarkov"
   authors = ["Your Name <your.email@example.com>"]

   [tool.poetry.dependencies]
   python = "^3.9"

   [tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
   pytest = "^7.0"
   black = "^23.0"
   mypy = "^1.0"
   flake8 = "^6.0"

   [build-system]
   requires = ["poetry-core>=1.0.0"]
   build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
   ```

2. Update Docker configuration to use Poetry
3. Update CI/CD pipeline
4. Remove requirements.txt
5. Update documentation

## Affected Components
- requirements.txt (to be removed)
- Dockerfile
- docker-compose.yml
- CI/CD configuration
- Development setup scripts

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] All dependencies are managed by Poetry
- [ ] Development environment works with Poetry
- [ ] Docker builds succeed with Poetry
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline uses Poetry
- [ ] Documentation reflects Poetry usage

## Dependencies
- None (infrastructure change)

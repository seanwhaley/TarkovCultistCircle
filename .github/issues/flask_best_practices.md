## Technical Context
Review and enhance the Flask application to ensure it follows all current best practices and patterns.

## Current State
The Flask application has basic implementation of:
- Blueprint structure
- Factory pattern
- Environment configurations
- Logging setup
- Unit tests

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Review routing patterns and organization
- [ ] Verify error handling and logging practices
- [ ] Check configuration management
- [ ] Evaluate testing coverage and methodology
- [ ] Review security implementations
- [ ] Assess performance optimizations

## Implementation Plan
1. Audit current codebase against Flask best practices
2. Document findings and recommendations
3. Implement improvements
4. Update documentation
5. Verify changes with comprehensive testing

## Affected Components
- src/application/app_factory.py
- src/blueprints/*
- src/config/*
- src/core/*
- Tests and documentation

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] All routes follow RESTful principles
- [ ] Error handling is consistent and informative
- [ ] Configuration management is secure and flexible
- [ ] Test coverage meets or exceeds 80%
- [ ] Security best practices are implemented
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect changes

## Dependencies
- Current Flask configuration
- Existing blueprints structure
- Testing framework
